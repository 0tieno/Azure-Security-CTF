# Azure-cloud_Security-CTF_hackathon 🚀🔐  

Welcome to the **Azure cloud Security Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges at **Hackfest 2.0**, a 7-day hackathon organized by **cyberEyes & CSK**. This event is designed to test and improve your **Azure cloud security skills** through **real-world security misconfigurations and threats**.  

## 🔥 Challenges Overview

The challenges are based on **real-world scenarios** and cover a wide range of **Azure security topics**, including:  

✅ **Storage Security** – Misconfigured storage accounts, public access, and SAS token exploitation.  
✅ **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – Azure AD misconfigurations, role assignments, and privilege escalation.  
✅ **Network Security** – Exposed virtual machines, firewall bypass, and NSG misconfigurations.  
✅ **CI/CD Security** – Secure DevOps pipelines, misconfigured secrets, and container security.  
✅ **Logging & Monitoring** – Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor logs, and security alerts.

🔹 Bypass **weak Network Security Group (NSG) rules** to access a restricted VM.  
🔹 Identify an **exposed RDP/SSH service** and gain access.  
🔹 Implement **firewall rules** to harden the network.  

### ⚙️ Challenge 4: **CI/CD Pipeline Secrets Leak** (300 Points)

🔹 Discover **hardcoded secrets** in a DevOps pipeline.  
🔹 Exploit **weak security configurations** in Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions.  
🔹 Secure the pipeline by implementing **secrets management best practices**.  

### 📊 Challenge 5: **Threat Detection & Incident Response** (350 Points)

🔹 Analyze **Azure Monitor Logs** and **Defender for Cloud alerts**.  
🔹 Investigate a **simulated attack** and find the attacker’s origin.  
🔹 Implement **detection rules** to prevent similar incidents.
